          <h2>Obesity:</h2>
          <p>
            - As it relates to poverty, we can see there is a slightly positive correlation between states' obesity rates and the percentange of the states' population living in poverty.
            - Age and Obesity do not appear to have a meaningful correlation at the state level.
            - One of the stronger correlations in the entire set, Obesity and Median Household Income have a clearly visible negative correlation. In better terms, obesity rates are lower in states with a higher Median Household Income.</p>

          <h2>Smoking:</h2>
          <p>
            - Another one of our stronger correlations, Smoking and Poverty have a slightly visible positive correlation.
            - When it comes to Smoking and Age, it appears that most states fall within a ten year age range for their median smoker's age. Only 4 of the datapoints in the entire dataset fall outside of ages 32 to 42.
            - Similar to Obesity and Median Household Income, we see a strong negative correlation between the percentange of smokers and the Median Household Income.</p>

          <h2>Healthcare:</h2>
          <p>
            - Similar to Obesity and Smoking, we see a strong positive correlation between the percentange of residents lacking healthcare and the percentange of residents in poverty.
            - Again, the Age group seems to show no reasonable correlation, and most datapoints fall between 32 and 42.
            - The weakest of the three groups, Median Household Income and percentange of residents lacking healthcare still show a visible negative correlation.</p>
